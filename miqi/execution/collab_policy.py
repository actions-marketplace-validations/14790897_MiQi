"""Collaboration policy — the confirm-card gate (issue #646, design v2).

Two AI reviews converged on: the model must never be the final decision
maker. The harness decides *when to ask*, the model decides *what to propose*.

This module is the Collaboration Policy layer:

    User Mode (Autonomy)
        ↓
    Policy Engine
        ├─ Safety Policy      → approval gate (allow/deny, bypassable)
        └─ Collaboration Policy → confirm card (this file, NOT bypassable)

Key design points (from the design-review doc in D:/Desktop/811):
- Risk-based autonomy: "automatic" is NOT "fully autonomous" — low-risk runs
  automatically, high-risk always confirms.
- Intent vs Safety: approval answers "may I?" (permission), the confirm card
  answers "is this the plan?" (decision). External transfers and payments
  ALWAYS confirm, regardless of approval bypass settings.
